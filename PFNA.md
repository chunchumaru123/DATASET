Background


Currently the review and analysis of all contracts for PFNA Procurement ($9B) is conducted manually, leaving significant risk of not identifying potential risks such as noncompliance, contract breaches, inconsistent payment terms, etc.
PFNA Procurement wants to pilot a solution using Generative AI that will not only summarize the contracts but also can answer key questions for the category managers instantaneously saving significant amount of time for the procurement team and also increasing the coverage of contract analysis
Challenges
Once the contract is in execution, the periodic contract review process is entirely manual and time consuming. It can therefore leave significant gaps in the analysis, thus leaving significant contract optimization opportunities on the table.
Objectives
To prove value of Generative AI infused contract intelligence which can can quickly identify opportunities to optimize contracts by identifying variances as compared to gold standard contracts in this sector and if it can provide rapid summaries of complex contract clauses, track compliance status with key metrics and report on upcoming contract expirations.
Recommendations
Develop a Proof-of-concept using sample existing contracts on Microsoftâ€™s open AI platform. PFNA Procurement team is funding the POC to be completed in 2023. Bring back the POC results in January 2024.
Due Diligence
The use case was taken through the GEN AI council and has been approved to proceed.
Discussed any legal ramifications of using GEN AI for contract summarization. Received approval from legal council that there are no significant risks to PepsiCo since none of the confidential data will leave the PepsiCo boundary and even though external SIs are used, they are bound by the existing GEN AI related NDAs. 
The architecture is very similar to the R&D use case that has been vetted.
Contracts currently are managed in SAP Ariba CLM and it currently does not offer this capability.
None of the other sectors have developed this capability. In fact, the development of such a capability has broader applicability to Global Procurement as well as corporate legal teams
