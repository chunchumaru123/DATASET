Phase 1 Scope: The project will process around 500 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enable quick searches for functional issue information. Phases 2 and beyond are planned but will proceed after Phase 1's success.

Funding and Users: Funding is confirmed, and the primary users will be IT SAP functional specialists and team leads.

Efficiency Gains: GenAI is expected to save approximately 3 weeks of onboarding time per specialist, reducing onboarding from 4 weeks to 1 week, resulting in potential savings of $75,000 per year in the EU region. Additionally, a reduction in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) could decrease business wait time in ticket resolution by 5,000 hours annually, positively impacting customer satisfaction.

Implementation and Integration: A chatbot will facilitate the solution, which should be operational in about 2 months. Minimal training is neededâ€”only an announcement and brief explanation. Integrations will include SharePoint, PepGenX, and Azure, but there will be no functional connection.

Document Details: The project involves about 500 semi-structured PDF documents, each ranging from 2-5 MB.

Overall Impact: The chatbot aligns with the strategy of addressing resource scarcity and improving productivity, focusing on enhancing onboarding and ticket resolution processes.
